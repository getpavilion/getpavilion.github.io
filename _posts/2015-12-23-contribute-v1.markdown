Need help or found a bug? Open an issue at [Github](http://github.com/getpavilion/pavilion) or tweet me at [@wesselgrift](http://twitter.com/wesselgrift).

##### Browser support
Although Pavilion is built for modern browsers, the CSS is prefixed for the last two versions of commonly used browsers.
Yes, this will increase the file size. But it's nice to have some browser support other than the latest versions.

If you find any bugs, please let me know and always test your productions thoroughly.

Cheers, Wessel.
