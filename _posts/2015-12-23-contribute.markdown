Need help or found a bug? Open an issue at [Github](http://github.com/getpavilion/pavilion) or tweet me at [@wesselgrift](http://twitter.com/wesselgrift).

##### Browser support
Although Pavilion is built for modern browsers, the CSS is prefixed for the last two versions of commonly used browsers.
Yes, this will increase the file size. But it's nice to have some browser support other than the latest versions.

If you find any bugs, please let me know and always test your productions thoroughly.

##### Mixins are coming
At the moment Pavilion uses classes which dictate styling trough DOM markup. This works fine and might even work fast in some cases. 
But it could cludge up your DOM, and its not really semantic. That is why Pavilion will gradually move towards using mixins for creating your layouts.
I haven't decided on how this will be implemented, but it is coming.

See the full roadmap <a href="https://github.com/getpavilion/pavilion/wiki" target="_blank" class="documentation-list-link">here</a>.

Cheers, Wessel.
