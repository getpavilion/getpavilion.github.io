After you've tweaked and configured the desired files you can run Grunt.js to compile your css.
The Grunt.js file has two tasks. The default task ( `grunt` ) has the following subtasks:

- grunt-contrib-clean
- grunt-contrib-sass
- grunt-autoprefixer
- grunt-stripcomments
- grunt-contrib-watch

If you only want to build, and not watch, use `grunt dist`.
Both tasks produce the following files in the `dist` folder:

```
dist/
├── pavilion.css
├── pavilion.min.css
└── pavilion.min.css.map
```
