EM's and REM's inherit a value set by a parent.
REM is different from EM in that it always inherits its value from the root element, which is your `html` tag.
The EM unit inherits it's value from its first parent with a specified font-size.

Pavilion uses EM's for typography and REM's for component margins, paddings or other properties.
One EM is equal to 18px, which is set on the `body`. One REM is equal to 15px, which is set 
on the `html` tag.

##### Smaller screens
On smaller screens the font-sizes on the body and html tags wil decrease, which will affect the EM's and REM's troughout the
rest of the DOM.
