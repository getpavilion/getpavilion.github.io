When creating layouts with columns there are a couple of things to consider. Pavilion leans on the following, common concept.

##### Grid basics
A `.container` wraps elements and provides you with left and right padding to keep the edges of the screen away
from your content. When placing columns inside containers, negative margin is used to prevent double padding (columns have padding too).
This is done by placing the columns inside a `.row`.

<h6 class="mute">Example</h6>
{% highlight html %}
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <!-- Columns go here, inside a row to prevent double paddings -->
    </div>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

##### Rules of thumb:
1. Always wrap a row in a container
2. Columns within a container must have a row as their first, immidiate parent
