<h5 id="browser-support">Browser support</h5>
<p>Altough Pavilion is built for modern browsers, the CSS is prefixed for the last two versions of commonly used browsers.
Yes, this will increase the file size. But itâ€™s nice to have some browser support other than the latest versions.</p>

<p>If you find any bugs, please let me know and always test your productions thoroughly.</p>

<p>Cheers, Wessel.</p>
