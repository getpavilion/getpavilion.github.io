<h5 id="flexbox">Flexbox</h5>
<p>From version 1.0.31 and up, all the <strong>flexbox classes</strong> have been removed. After a period of 1,5 years of using these classes it was apparand that the classes always required further customization and that the classes did not offer enough flexibility. Thus the whole idea of standardizing the flexible layout module with classes does no longer hold water in the case of Pavilion.</p>

<p>If you are still using the deprecated flexbox classes, donâ€™t worry. The classes from different Pavilion releases are still available in the following Gists. Aswell as the general documentation from version 1.0.28 and later.</p>
