<p>EM’s and REM’s inherit a value set by a parent.
REM is different from EM in that it always inherits its value from the root element, which is your <code>html</code> tag.
The EM unit inherits it’s value from its first parent with a specified font-size.</p>

<p>Pavilion uses EM’s for typography and REM’s for component margins, paddings or other properties.
One EM is equal to 18px, which is set on the <code>body</code>. One REM is equal to 15px, which is set 
on the <code>html</code> tag.</p>

<h5 id="smaller-screens">Smaller screens</h5>
<p>On smaller screens the font-sizes on the body and html tags wil decrease, which will affect the EM’s and REM’s troughout the
rest of the DOM.</p>
