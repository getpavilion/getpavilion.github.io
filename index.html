            Pavilion was created out of the need for a simple, unopinionated CSS framework, ready for the future. Pavilion is built for front-end web developers who tend to never use the hundreds of pre-made UI components some frameworks ship with.
            Built for front-end developers who lean towards creativity, exploration and creating UI components themselves from the ground up whilst depending on a solid foundation with future-proof capabilities.
            <br><br>
            The idea is that pre-made UI elements never really suit your needs for 100%. You’ll end up customizing them anyway. Pavilion lays down the groundwork, the rest is up to you.
